/**
 * The API disabled the destination because deliveries to it failed for longer than the same threshold as for `sustained_failure`, and the most recent failed delivery failed with an invalid address: the DNS answer says that the endpoint's hostname doesn't exist or doesn't have an address, or the address that the API would connect to isn't publicly routable or is reserved, for example a loopback, link-local, private-network, or cloud-metadata address. The API doesn't connect to such an address, and retries the delivery a bounded number of times as it does after a timeout. A timeout or a server failure of the DNS lookup is a temporary DNS failure instead, not an invalid address.
