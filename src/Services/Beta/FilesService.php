     *
     * Defaults to `20`. Ranges from `1` to `1000`.
     * @param string|null $page Query param: Opaque page cursor returned in a prior list response's `next_page`. Prefixed `page_`.
     * @param string $scopeID Query param: Filter by scope ID. Only returns files associated with the specified scope (e.g., a session ID).
     * @param list<string|AnthropicBeta|value-of<AnthropicBeta>> $betas Header param: Optional header to specify the beta version(s) you want to use.
     * @param string $workspaceID Header param: Optional header to select the Workspace for this request. The value is a Workspace ID (for example, `wrkspc_011CZkZaBF1tNoB5wlCeusgy`).
     *

     * @throws CMEKKeyNetworkBlockedException The key management service's network access controls blocked the request to the workspace's customer-managed encryption key. The key itself may be healthy.
